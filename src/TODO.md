- Flesh out content a lot, cleanup, modularize loops (per dungeon floor?)
- Think about cards that appear from nowhere (like, a level-up, or when you die, separate to traditional mechanism)
- come up with more animations to apply to tiles and use them a bit more
- maybe start using Timers (w/ the bus) to put delays on things
- How are you going to handle long-running status effects (like poisoning the player) (this doesn't sound very MVP to me so hmmm)
- Combat, targeting, etc to go into separate (orthogonal?) stack and then resolve as card exits? Useful for eg spell-targeting or something
