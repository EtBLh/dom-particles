- You have a "hand" with empty slots (default something like: https://game-icons.net/lorc/originals/hand.html)
- Maybe represent your hand at 90 deg to the main dungeon cards so that it's distinct
- Each turn, you play a combination of dungeon cards and hand cards. Some - eg weapons cards - are infinitely playable and return to your hand after. Others can only be used once.
- Options you always have: One-ups (burn a corridor card) Two-ups (like attack creature with weapon, or use an empty hand card to pick up a dungeon card) Three-and-up (two attack cards and a creature, an attack, a combo card, and a creature) 
- On top of that, some cards are pickable-up (or swappable) so you can maintain your hand. 
- Generally larger combinations of cards are more powerful. 
- Maintain a "quest deck" as well as your base hand, which is shuffled into the dungeon deck? Maybe.
- Combinations and throw leftmost card away each time (yeah, do need to think about what no-op is.)
- Creatures come back if you slip past them (let them fall off to the left)
- Flesh out content a lot, cleanup, modularize loops (per dungeon floor?)
- Think about cards that appear from nowhere (like, a level-up, or when you die, separate to traditional mechanism)
- come up with more animations to apply to tiles and use them a bit more
- maybe start using Timers (w/ the bus) to put delays on things
- How are you going to handle long-running status effects (like poisoning the player) (this doesn't sound very MVP to me so hmmm)
- Combat, targeting, etc to go into separate (orthogonal?) stack and then resolve as card exits? Useful for eg spell-targeting or something
