- unit tests for particle / emitter / manager
- better fromDOMNode functionality (ideally, get it working, like, at all) 
- finish examples page (maybe make source code editable too?)

- currently out of scope:
  - full 3d (with z-coord)
  - probably the timing thing (see above) - the broader point is if there's no time-control etc, then the autostart argument is pretty redundant
